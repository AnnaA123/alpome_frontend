I used yarn as the package manager (while the backend uses npm), 
but did not include any files using yarn, so downloading packages can be a bit of a hassle.

The packages needed (for now) are:

<h3>react-router-dom</h3>

(I'll update later if any more are added)

The header and navigation menu.

API requests to the backend(s). The apiURL is at the top of the page.
